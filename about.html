	<div id="about">
	<p>Tesla is a revolutionary car company creates cars that are the pinnacle of the 21st century's technology. They are fully electric vehicles that have handling and raw power that rivals that of their gasoline-powered counterparts. All current Tesla models are capable of driving themselves for potentially vast distances with the aid of a new feature called autopilot.</p>
	<h3>Autopilot</h3>
	<p>Autopilot is the function embedded in every current Tesla model that allows the vehicle to operate fully automatically on the road with the ability to stay a safe distance from the car in front of it at all times, while staying at or below the posted speed limit. The car is also capable of self-steering on roads that have clearly-marked lanes. Cameras and sonar sensors are used to guide the car automatically. While it is still not recommended, as autopilot is far from being a perfect substitute for a human driver, people have been known to become otherwise occupied while operating their Tesla vehicles in autopilot mode. They have been known to fall asleep, play games on their cellular phones, and perform various other tasks "while driving."</p>
